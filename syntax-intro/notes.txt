New things/notes:
======================
* `` is reserved for multi-line strings and can have ${} which is called a template string
* null and undefined types: sub-types of all other types (allow values of null and undefined)
* arrays here remind me of vectors in C++
* tuples here are like lists in Python, except have fixed size and need types declared
* enums are just like enums in C++
* any type: allows for dynamic typing
* unknown type: any value can be assigned, but unlike type any, . operator and function calls can not be used on the variable
* type assertion: like type casting
* === checks if types and values are the same
* == will perform type conversions if necessary and check values
* optional paramters (ones with ?) are default undefined if not given a value
* default paramters are like optional paramters, but with default values
* class members are default public
